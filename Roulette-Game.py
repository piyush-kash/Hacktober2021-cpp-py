Roulette-Game:
Python program simulates the game of roulette. In roulette, a wheel spins 
and yields a number between 1 and 49 when a ball drops into a numbered slot. 
The initial amount is monitored throughout the game and will be reminded to 
the player after each guess. If the amount goes zero, then the game ends.
